# Pokeball (SketchUp 2017 → STL)

## Mesh repair
SketchUp exports here are at **16× working scale** and often non-manifold.
- Check: `python scripts/diag_stl.py <file.stl>` (needs `pip install trimesh pymeshfix manifold3d`)
- Fix: `python scripts/repair_shell.py <in.stl> <out.stl> --scale 16 --flat-z <bed plane z in source units>`
  (`--no-trim` if the part has no flat bed spot). Output is mm, min corner at origin.
- `redsmaller.stl` is repaired (watertight, 46.51 × 45.02 × 21.06 mm, 3350.9 mm³).
  The unrepaired export is in commit `6fe8dd9`.

## Avoiding broken exports (SketchUp 2017 Make — no built-in Solid Tools)
- Defects in both redsmaller/redsphere sit at the flat-spot cut: leftover sphere cap below
  the plane, coincident stray faces, holes ⇒ the flat spot was made with a plane +
  Intersect Faces + manual delete. Cut with **Eneroth Solid Tools** instead (installed
  2026-10-07 from github.com/Eneroth3/eneroth-solid-tools 3.0.1; Tools → Eneroth Solid
  Tools → Union/Subtract/Trim/Intersect, plus a toolbar). Click target first, then
  modifier; Subtract deletes the modifier, Trim keeps it. Both must be solid groups.
- Entity Info must read "Solid Group" (with a volume) before export; if not, run
  Tools → Solid Inspector² (installed 2026-10-07 from github.com/thomthom/solid-inspector
  v2.5.1, no TT_Lib² needed).
- Vertices ~0.02 units apart on the rim at 16× ⇒ still near SketchUp's merge tolerance;
  a larger working scale (model mm as metres, ×1000) gives more margin.

## Open
- **CleanUp³ needs TT_Lib² ≥ 2.11** — CleanUp³ 3.4.3 files are in
  `%APPDATA%\SketchUp\SketchUp 2017\SketchUp\Plugins\tt_cleanup`, but TT_Lib² is not
  installed. Not on GitHub (`thomthom/tt-lib` is the different tt-lib³; `thomthom/cleanup`
  master 3.4.6 still requires TT_Lib²), no Wayback copy. Only source: SketchUp's
  Window → Extension Warehouse (free Trimble ID sign-in, installs directly) or
  sketchucation.com/plugin/726-tt_lib.
- `redsphere.stl` (untracked, 16×): 12 holes (11 around the flat spot at z=-93.22, one
  3.5×2.2-unit hole on the outer wall at y=-357, z=158), 15 non-manifold edges, 10 loose
  zero-thickness fragments on the flat-spot plane, sphere cap dipping 4 units below it.
  Fix if wanted: commit it, then
  `python scripts/repair_shell.py redsphere.stl redsphere.stl --flat-z -93.22`.
- `redflat.stl`, `red2.stl` also non-manifold; not analysed.
- `redsmaller.stl` bed contact is a 35 mm² disc (~6.7 mm) — consider a brim.
